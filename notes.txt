Todo app:

todo-items:
    Objects
    Should contain:
        -title
        -description
        -due date
        -priority
        -notes
        -checklist

todo-lists:
    Should be objects that contains todo items
    There should be a default list where items appear if no custom list has been created
    Contains:
        -todo-items
        -title
        -description

keep todo logic in modules seperate from DOM-related logic
